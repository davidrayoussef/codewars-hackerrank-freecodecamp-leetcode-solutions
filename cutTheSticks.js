// You are given  sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer.
// A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

// Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths: 5 4 4 2 2 8

// Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks.
// For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 3 2 2 6
// The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

// Given the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.
// Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).
